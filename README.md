**siren** is an AI-powered real-time safety monitoring system that detects road accidents using CCTV footage, analyzes vehicle and speed data, summarizes incidents using GenAI, and alerts nearby emergency responders — reducing response time and improving public safety.

## Features

-  **Accident Detection**  
  Detects road accidents in real-time from CCTV feeds using YOLOv8.

-  **Vehicle & Speed Analysis**  
  Identifies vehicle types, calculates estimated speed, and assesses accident severity.

-  **Incident Summarization**  
  Uses Gemini (Google GenAI) API to convert raw detection data into clear, human-readable reports.

-  **Automated Emergency Alerts**  
  Sends alerts to nearby hospitals and police stations, improving coordination and response efficiency.

-  **Django Dashboard**  
  Provides an intuitive interface for hospitals and police to view incidents and manage responses.
